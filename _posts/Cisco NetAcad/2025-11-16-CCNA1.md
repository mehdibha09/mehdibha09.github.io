## CCNA: Introduction to Networks – Cisco Networking Academy

I completed the **CCNA: Introduction to Networks** course through **Cisco Networking Academy** on **November 16, 2025**. This course forms the first part of the CCNA certification path and provides an in-depth introduction to essential networking concepts, IP addressing, and device configuration.

### What I Learned

- **Network Fundamentals:** I gained a solid understanding of how networks operate, including devices, topologies, protocols, and the OSI model.  
- **IPv4 & IPv6 Addressing:** I learned how to create and analyze IP subnets, configure IPv4/IPv6 addressing, and troubleshoot addressing issues.  
- **Ethernet & Data Link Concepts:** I explored how Ethernet frames work, MAC addressing, switching operations, and collision/ broadcast domains.  
- **Switching & Routing Basics:** I practiced configuring connectivity between switches, routers, and end devices to enable communication across local and remote networks.  
- **IP Connectivity & Services:** I learned how routing decisions are made, how default gateways operate, and how to provide basic network services.  
- **Hands-on Labs:** I completed up to **54 labs** using **Cisco hardware** or **Packet Tracer**, accumulating up to **14 hours of practical networking experience**.

### Why This Course Was Valuable

This course provided essential knowledge for building, securing, and troubleshooting modern networks. It also established the technical foundation required for the full **CCNA certification**, emphasizing practical, lab-based skills with real Cisco devices and simulators.

### Key Skills Gained

- Ethernet and switching fundamentals  
- IPv4 and IPv6 addressing & subnetting  
- IP services and connectivity  
- Network device configuration  
- Understanding of physical, data-link, and network layer protocols  
- Hands-on experience with Cisco routers, switches, and Packet Tracer
