## Networking Devices & Initial Configuration – Cisco Networking Academy

I completed the **Networking Devices and Initial Configuration** course on **Cisco Networking Academy** on **January 23, 2025**, earning a student-level credential that deepened my understanding of network infrastructure. This intermediate-level course includes approximately 22 hours of learning through engaging multimedia content, labs, quizzes, and Packet Tracer simulations. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

### What I Learned

- **Hierarchical Network Design:** I learned how to structure reliable, scalable networks using Cisco best practices. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Virtualization & Cloud Services:** I understood the essentials and benefits of virtualization and cloud computing. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **IPv4 Addressing & Subnetting:** I practiced calculating IPv4 address schemes and subnet masks. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **Network Protocols & Operations:** I explored how Ethernet, ARP, DNS, DHCP, TCP/UDP, and Cisco IOS support network communication. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- **Packet Tracer Labs:** I configured Cisco devices and assembled small networks in Packet Tracer, completing up to 7 labs and 12 simulation activities. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

### Skills Demonstrated

- Cisco IOS & Device Configuration  
- IPv4 Subnetting & Addressing  
- ARP, DHCP, DNS, Ethernet, & Transport Layer Protocols  
- Virtualization & Cloud Concepts  
- Network Troubleshooting & Packet Tracer Simulation

### Why This Course Was Valuable

This course gave me foundational skills in designing and setting up small Cisco-based networks, bridging theoretical knowledge with hands-on practice. It prepared me for more advanced tracks in both **networking (DevNet / CCNA)** and **cybersecurity (Cyber Ops / SOC)**. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
