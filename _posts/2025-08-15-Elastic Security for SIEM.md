## Elastic Security for SIEM – Elastic On-Demand Training

I completed the **Elastic Security for SIEM** course offered as **On-Demand training by Elastic** on **August 15, 2025**. This extensive training (approximately 24 hours) provided me with the practical knowledge required to build and utilize a robust SIEM using the Elastic Stack.  

### What I Learned

- **Elastic Stack Architecture:** I understood how Elasticsearch, Kibana, Elastic Agents, and Fleet integrate to build an effective SIEM solution. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- **Data Ingestion & Normalization:** I learned methods to collect, parse, and enrich security data using Beats and Elastic Common Schema (ECS) to ensure consistency and usability in analysis. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Detection Engine & Analytics:** I explored how to use Kibana’s Security app, create visualizations, leverage anomaly detection, and manage alerts and queries for threat hunting. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

### Why This Course Was Valuable

This training deepened my understanding of how to implement a state-of-the-art SIEM platform using the Elastic ecosystem. It empowered me with the ability to monitor environments in real-time, analyze security events, and respond effectively—all key skills for roles in **Security Operations, Blue Teaming**, and **Cyber Threat Intelligence**.
