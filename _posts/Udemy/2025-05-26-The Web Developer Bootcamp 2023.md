## The Web Developer Bootcamp 2023 – Colt Steele (Udemy)

I completed **The Web Developer Bootcamp 2023** by **Colt Steele** on **Udemy**, finishing on **May XX, 2025**. This is one of the most comprehensive full-stack web development courses available—spanning over **70 hours of content**, with a **10-hour React expansion pack**. It equipped me with the skills to build real-world applications from scratch. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

### What I Learned

- **Fundamentals & Modern Tools**: I mastered HTML5, CSS3, modern JavaScript (ES6+), along with frameworks like Flexbox, Bootstrap 5, Semantic UI, and Bulma. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Full-Stack Development**: I built blog applications and a large-scale Yelp-like project using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, REST APIs, authentication (cookies & sessions), and deployed them to the cloud. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **React & Modern Front-End**: Through the React expansion pack, I learned React basics—JSX, props, state, hooks (like useEffect), React design patterns, Vite, and Material-UI. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **Web Security Awareness**: I gained exposure to common security vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection and XSS, along with best practices to mitigate them. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- **Developer Workflow & Tools**: I improved my proficiency with Git, NPM, Postman, the terminal, and learned to build responsive layouts, interact with databases (SQL vs. NoSQL), and manipulate the DOM. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

### Why This Course Was Valuable

This course is widely praised for its modern, job-market-ready curriculum and engaging teaching style. Colt Steele revamped the content extensively, ensuring relevance by adding real-world projects like YelpCamp and continuously updating topics. Participants—many of whom were complete beginners—have gone on to secure developer roles at top-tier companies. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

The React segment, though recently added and not exhaustive, offers a solid start into front-end frameworks and can be built upon with specialized React courses. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
