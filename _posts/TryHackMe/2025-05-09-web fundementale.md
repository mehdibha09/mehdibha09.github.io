## Web Fundamentals – TryHackMe

I completed the **Web Fundamentals** learning path on **TryHackMe** to build a solid foundation in web application security. This path provided a structured approach to understanding how web applications function, identifying common vulnerabilities, and applying industry-standard tools to assess and secure web applications.

### What I Learned

- **Web Technologies & HTTP Basics:** I gained an understanding of how web browsers and servers communicate using HTTP/S protocols, including request/response cycles and status codes.  
- **Common Web Vulnerabilities:** I explored major vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR), learning how they occur and how to mitigate them.  
- **Web Application Assessment Tools:** I learned to use tools like Burp Suite for intercepting and analyzing web traffic, identifying vulnerabilities, and performing security assessments.  
- **Hands-on Labs & Real-World Scenarios:** I applied my knowledge in practical labs, simulating real-world web application environments to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in a controlled setting.

### Why This Path Was Valuable

Completing the Web Fundamentals path enhanced my understanding of web application security, which is crucial for roles in **Red Team operations**, **penetration testing**, and **bug bounty hunting**. It provided me with the skills to assess and secure web applications effectively, laying the groundwork for more advanced security challenges.
