## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m Mehdi, a Network student at ISIMA with a strong interest in cybersecurity, focusing on defensive operations (Blue Team/SOC) and network security.

I have been exploring areas such as monitoring, threat detection, incident response, and network security through labs, simulations, and academic projects. This has given me a solid understanding of cybersecurity concepts and practices.

I am passionate about analyzing threats, learning how to improve security controls, and exploring defensive strategies to protect networks from cyber attacks. I enjoy solving challenges, experimenting with security tools, and deepening my knowledge in network and cybersecurity techniques.
